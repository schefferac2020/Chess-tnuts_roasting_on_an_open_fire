C++ SDL chess engine! A work in progress. 

Decided to use bitmaps to store the game board. For more information see this [wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards)

Just finished a sudo legal move generator so it's almost fully playable. Just need to add en passant, castling, and promotion. Soon I'll be making a simple
move search algorithm to find the next "best" move. 

All the cool piece art was done by [Emeline](https://github.com/EmRobotics).

## WARNING
To all asthmatic readers stop reading now!!! The following joke is too funny.

Where do chess players like to go to look for a bargain?

...

The pawnshop.
